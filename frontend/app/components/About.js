                    Red is an open source Discord bot powered by <a href="https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py/" target="_blank"><b>discord.py</b></a>

                    <br/>
                    By default it includes fun general commands, audio playback (mp3, YouTube and more!), moderation commands, slot machines and much more!

                    Cogs are what makes Red unique among other bots, they provide an almost endless amount of addition bot functionality
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Basically if you think of something you want your bot to do - there probably is a cog for that or it's currently being made

                    <br/>
                    This website was made to help Red users find new and interesting cogs for their bots
